[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)](https://github.com/josvictoronofre/SpringBoot-project/blob/main/LICENSE)
## About
Along the development of this project several objectives were set to demonstrate knowledge on different matters regarding back-end development:
- Creating a Spring Boot project with Java
- Implementing a domain model
- Structuring logical layers: resource, service, repository
- Configuring test database (H2)
- Populating database
- CRUD
- Exception treatment

# Used Technologies
## Back-end
- Java
- Spring Boot
- JPA / Hibernate
- Maven
- Postman
- H2 database engine

# How to execute project
## Requirements
- Java 17
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- Either use Postman or the H2 database to access the data

## Commands
Clone the git repository to the desired destination in your machine
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:josvictoronofre/SpringBoot-project.git
```
Next use the Maven command to run the program as a Spring Boot application
```bash
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
From there you can access the database using either Postman or the H2 test database to check tables and use the normal CRUD commands
